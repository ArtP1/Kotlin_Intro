## Introduction to Kotlin

Kotlin is a modern programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and can be used for a wide range of applications. It was developed by JetBrains and officially announced as an official language for Android development by Google. Kotlin combines object-oriented and functional programming concepts, providing a concise and expressive syntax.

## Getting Started

To start coding in Kotlin, you need to set up your development environment. Here are the steps:

  1. Install the latest version of the Java Development Kit ([JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)) if you haven't already.
  2. Install an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), which includes built-in Kotlin support.

**Once Installed & IntelliJ has been launched:**
  1. Click `Get from VCS`
  2. Paste the Repository HTTPS Url
  3. Navigate to [/Kotlin_Intro/src/main/kotlin](https://github.com/ArtP1/Kotlin_Intro/tree/master/src/main/kotlin)
## Variables and Data Types

In Kotlin, you declare variables using the `val` or `var` keyword. The `val` keyword is used for read-only variables, whereas the `var` keyword is used for mutable variables. Kotlin provides a rich set of data types, including numbers, characters, strings, booleans, arrays, and more.

## Control Flow

Control flow statements in Kotlin allow you to control the execution order of your program. Kotlin supports conditional statements such as `if`, `when`, and looping statements such as `for` and `while`. This section will guide you through the various control flow statements available in Kotlin.

## Functions

Functions are an essential part of any programming language. In Kotlin, functions are declared using the `fun` keyword. You'll learn how to define functions, pass arguments, specify return types, and utilize function extensions in Kotlin.

## Classes and Objects

Kotlin is an object-oriented language, and it provides powerful features for defining classes and creating objects. This section will cover the basics of class and object creation, inheritance, interfaces, and other object-oriented concepts in Kotlin.

## Collections

Collections are used to store and manipulate groups of data in Kotlin. Kotlin provides a rich set of collection classes, including lists, sets, maps, and more. You'll explore how to create and manipulate collections in Kotlin.

## Extensions

Kotlin allows you to extend existing classes with new functionality using extension functions and properties. You'll learn how to define extension functions and properties and how to utilize them to enhance existing classes in Kotlin.
